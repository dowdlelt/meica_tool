# meica_tool

I've created a handy matlab script that works with meica.py (https://bitbucket.org/prantikk/me-ica) v3 - from the experimental branch. 
It creates a series of figures that are useful for visualizing the output in a quick manner. 

First, it plots the estimated motion parameters, and framewise displacement (bramila tools used here). 
Then it plots each component that was generated by meica.py, color coded on whether they were:
BOLD-like - green
Non-BOLD - Red
r2 weighted - pink
Ignored - black. 

It then creates a bar plot showing the relative variance of each of those categories. 

Its ugly code, but effective...for now.
